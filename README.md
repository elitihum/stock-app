## About

People invest in stocks to gain money. So we thought, what are the best
strategies to lose money on the stock exchange?

The stock trading game is a virtual stock trading platform where the goal is to
lose the most amount of money. Each investor starts with an initial sum of one
million dollars and can purchase stocks of their choosing from the NASDAQ Stock
Exchange.

We think that by understanding how to lose money, youâ€™ll become (marginally)
better at making money too.

## Motivations

After developing mobile/desktop applications for the last few years we wanted to
explore web technologies used by startups and large enterprises. We chose two
popular web technologies to cover fundamental concepts used in full-stack
projects: React and Django. These allowed us to construct the site and server
within eight days. The potential to rapidly develop and scale ideas on the web
is ideal for our future entrepreneurial ventures and personal projects.
